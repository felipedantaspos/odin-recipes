This is a TOP project for me to practice all the skills that i learned from the course.

HTML and GIT basics.

In this project i used this set of skills:

- Made the html boilerplate manually
- Used anchor tags (<a>) for links
- Used list tags (<ul>, <ol> and <li>) and relative paths to my pages, and for listing the links.
- Used images tag (<img>) for my images
- Create and organized my repository
- Used the best practice of commit early and often my project changes.
